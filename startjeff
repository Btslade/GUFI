you might start on your mac, it might build with no changes untar and look
at BigReadme for what the programs do and what the utilities are makejeff
is a script that might just build on your mac with no change look at that
script - it has linux and mac compile lines - the xattrs are different on
mac and linux hopefully that will just build on your mac and with
appropriate mods will just build on linux (it use to build on linux on a
system with sqlite) you have to have sqlite3 on your mac, most linux
distros have it i think, cadillac did i think sqlite3 is the only prereq
for most of it

So start with read BigReadme
and then move on to 
makejeff
then to run a test of all those functions build in makejeff
run
runjeff

There is a testdirectory in the tar called testdir and that is the model directory
so the runjeff does stuff like
do a depth first walk on testdir
do a breadth first walk on testdir
create a gufi in a created directory testdirdup  from testdir
run queries on that gufi
make a tree index on testdirdup
run queries on that gufi with a tree index
run a breadth first walk on testdir and make a flat file with path and attrs delimited
create a gufi at testdirdup1 that is from that flat delimited file
do a query on that new gufi (that has no tree index) that you built from a flat file from a bf walk 

There is a bunch of code to make the directories and files in the gufi
mimic the input tree permissions/ownership etc.  I dont think that code has
been run much because i always run as me and not root, so that part
probably doesnt even work.

questions - fire away on email - dont struggle on anything - i am happy to
explain what it does or is suppose to do

the schema needs to be worked on, it needs various things added like record
type and maybe record insert time as well as maybe a create time etc.  we
can talk about that once you have this version of the code up and working
and are started on the rewrite using more modularity/etc.
