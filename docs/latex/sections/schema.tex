\section{Database Schema}
GUFI stores extracted metadata in SQLite 3 database files. Each
database file contains a fixed set of tables and views designed to
assist with efficient querying of metadata from GUFI.

\subsection{\entries}
The \entries table contains file and link metadata extracted from the
source filesystem using \stat, \readlink, \listxattr, and
\getxattr. There are also a few OS specific columns (\texttt{oss*})
that are currently unused.

\subsection{Directory \summary}
The directory \summary table contains the metadata of the current
directory. Additionally, it contains columns that summarizes the
\entries table located in the same database file, such as minimum and
maximum file sizes, uids, and gids. These summary columns can be used
to determine whether or not \querydb needs to query the \entries table
at all.

\subsection{\pentries}
The original \pentries view was \texttt{SELECT entries.*,
  summary.inode FROM entries, summary}. It was defined so in order to
not store the parent inode of each entry, which would be the same for
every entry.

With the addition of extended attributes, the \pentries table was
modified to also union with the \pentriesrollup table, which is all
child \pentries views copied into the current directory.

In general, users should query the \pentries view over the \entries
table in order to obtain complete sets of data to query on.

\subsection{\treesummary}
Similar to the directory \summary table, GUFI also provides
functionality to generate \treesummary tables. Instead of summarizing
only the data found in the entries table of the current directory, the
\treesummary table summarizes the contents of the entire subtree,
allowing for queries to completely skip processing entire subtries.

Generating \treesummary tables can be a very costly operation if done
on every single directory. Due to this, \treesummary tables are not
generated by default. Instead, they are generated by the \bfti
executable that must be run manually after indexing has completed.
