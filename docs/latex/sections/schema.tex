\section{Database Schema}
GUFI stores extracted metadata in SQLite 3 database files. Each
database file contains a fixed set of tables and views designed to
assist with efficient querying of metadata from GUFI.

\subsection{Tables and Views}
\subsubection{\entries Table}
The \entries table contains file and link metadata extracted from the
source filesystem using \stat, \readlink, \listxattr, and
\getxattr. There are also a few OS specific columns (\texttt{oss*})
that are currently unused.

\subsubsection{Directory \summary Table}
The directory \summary table contains the metadata of the current
directory. Additionally, it contains columns that summarizes the
\entries table located in the same database file, such as minimum and
maximum file sizes, uids, and gids. These summary columns can be used
to determine whether or not \query needs to query the \entries table
at all.

\subsubsection{\pentries View}
\pentries is a simple view that attaches the directory's inode to the
\entries table as the \texttt{pinode} column. This view was created
because each entry in the directory will have the same
\texttt{pinode}. Storing repeated data here did not serve a purpose,
and thus is obtained through a view instead of a table.

\subsection{\treesummary Table}
Similar to the directory \summary table, GUFI also provides
functionality to generate \treesummary tables. Instead of summarizing
only the data found in the entries table of the current directory, the
\treesummary table summarizes the contents of the entire subtree,
allowing for queries to completely skip processing entire subtries.

Generating \treesummary tables can be a very costly operation if done
on every single directory. Due to this, \treesummary tables are not
generated by default. Instead, they are generated by the \bfti
executable that must be run manually after indexing has completed.
