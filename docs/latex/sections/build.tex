\section{Build}

\subsection{CMake}
From the root directory of the GUFI source, run:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. [options]
make
\end{verbatim}

The recommended options for deployment are
\texttt{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release -DCLIENT=On}.
\\\\
GUFI is known to build on Ubuntu Xenial, OpenSuse~12.3, CentOS~7,
CentOS~8, and OSX~10.13.

\subsection{Options}
The build can be configured with many options:

\subsubsection{Environment}
\begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
  \hline
  Setting & Explanation \\
  \hline
  CXX=false & Disable building of C++ code \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{CMake}
\begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
  \hline
  \texttt{-D<VAR>=<VALUE>} & Explanation \\
  \hline
  \texttt{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=<PATH>} & Install to a custom directory
  when running `make install` \\
  \hline
  \texttt{CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug} & Build with warnings and debugging
  symbols turned on \\
  \hline
  \texttt{CLIENT=<On|Off>} & Whether or not to install paramiko and
  gufi\_client \\
  & when make install is called \\
  \hline
  \texttt{DEP\_DOWNLOAD\_PREFIX=<PATH>} & Location of downloaded
  dependencies \\
  & - If the expected files are
  found, they will not be downloaded. \\
  & - The default path points to
  the bundled dependencies. \\
  \hline
  \texttt{DEP\_BUILD\_DIR\_PREFIX=<PATH>} & Location to build
  dependencies. \\
  & - Defaults to
  \$\{CMAKE\_BINARY\_DIR\}/builds \\
  \hline
  \texttt{DEP\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=<PATH>} &  Location to install the
  dependencies.  \\
  & - Defaults to
  \$\{CMAKE\_BINARY\_DIR\}/deps\\
  & - If the dependencies are not
  installed in \$\{CMAKE\_BINARY\_DIR\}, \\
  & \ \ they will not need to be
  redownloaded/rebuilt/reinstalled \\
  & \ \ everytime
  \$\{CMAKE\_BINARY\_DIR\} is deleted. \\
  \hline
  \texttt{CUMULATIVE\_TIMES=<On|Off>} & Print cumulative statistics at
  the end of some executables. \\
  & Requires
  \texttt{CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug}. \\
  \hline
  \texttt{PER\_THREAD\_STATS=<On|Off>} & Print \texttt{gufi\_query}
  event timestamps.\\
  & Requires
  \texttt{CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug}. \\

  \hline
  \texttt{SQL\_EXEC=<On|Off>} & Compile \texttt{gufi\_query} without
  calls to \texttt{sqlite3\_exec}. \\
  \hline
  \texttt{BENCHMARK=On} & Build so that \texttt{gufi\_query} prints out
  some benchmarks at the \\
  & end of a run. Make target 'benchmark' is
  created. This target \\
  & generates a source tree, indexes the tree, and
  queries the tree. At \\
  & each step, benchmark values will be
  printed. The tree is deleted \\
  & after the benchmarks complete.\\
  \hline
  \texttt{BENCHMARK\_ROOT=<PATH>} & Directory to place benchmark tree
  and index under\\
  \hline
  \texttt{BENCHMARK\_DIRS=<COUNT>} &  Default: 4\\
