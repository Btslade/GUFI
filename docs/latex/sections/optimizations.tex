\subsection{Optimizations}
In order for GUFI to be performant, many optimizations were used and
implemented.

\subsubsection{Reducing Branching}
In order to reduce the number of failed branch predictions experienced
by GUFI, branching was removed where possible. The main way this was
done was by intentionally skipping \texttt{NULL} pointer checks that
are repeated or always expected to be valid.

\subsubsection{Allocations}
Dynamic allocations are more costly to make than static
allocations. To reduce the amount of dynamic allocations, C-string are
usually declared as fixed size arrays instead of pointers.

Additionally, allocations are not performed by the standard
malloc. Instead, \texttt{jemalloc(3)} is used to override
\texttt{malloc(3)}. See \href{https://jemalloc.net/}{jemalloc's
  website} for details.

\subsubsection{Combining Strings with \memcpy}
One method of combining C-strings is by concantenating them with
\texttt{snprintf(3)} with format strings containing only \texttt{\%s}
format specifiers. Instead of parsing the format string, the
\texttt{SNFORMAT\_S} function was created to do \memcpy s on
the arguments, skipping figuring out whether or not inputs are strings
and how long they are by finding NULL terminators. Instead, lengths are
obtained as by-products of previous string manipulations and the
values are reused.

\subsubsection{Database Templates}
Every directory in an index contains at least one database file,
called db.db, containing the \lstat data from the source
filesystem. When creating indicies, a database file is created with
the same schema as db.db and is left unfilled. When each directory in
the index is processed, the database file created earlier is copied
into the directory as a bytestream instead of having SQlite open new
database files for each directory. This avoids the multitudes of
checks done by SQLite when setting up databases and tables. The same
is done for external xattr database files.

\subsubsection{SQLite}
As SQLite is a major component in GUFI, attempts were made to optimize
its usage. Some optimizations were made at compile time. See the
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html}{SQLite Compile-time
  Options} page for details.

\paragraph{Locking}
In order to prevent multiple threads from corrupting data, SQLite
implements locking. In GUFI, each database is only ever accessed by
one thread:

\begin{itemize}
\item When indexing, only one thread writes to each directory's
  database.
\item When querying, writes only occur when aggregating, which
  involves writing to a per-thread intermediate database before
  performing the final aggregating serially.
\end{itemize}

Locking despite never modifying databases in parallel was not useful,
and was removed by setting \texttt{-DSQLITE\_THREADSAFE=0} in the
compile flags.

\paragraph{VFS}
In addition to not locking SQLite in-memory operations, locking at the
filesystem level was also disabled. Instead of opening SQLite database
files with the default VFS, GUFI uses the \texttt{unix-none} VFS,
which causes all file locking to become no-ops. See
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/vfs.html}{The SQLite OS Interface or
  ``VFS''} for details.

\paragraph{Memory Tracking}
Memory tracking was disabled with \\
\noindent \texttt{-DSQLITE\_DEFAULT\_MEMSTATUS=0}.

\paragraph{Temporary Files}
Temporary files can be stored to disk or in memory. GUFI forces all
temporary files to be stored in memory with \\
\texttt{-DSQLITE\_TEMP\_STORE=3}.

\subsubsection{Caching Queries (Not Merged)}
When queries are performed on indicies, they are processed from
scratch by each thread for each directory. An obvious optimization
would be to reduce the amount of string parsing and query planning by
compiling each query once (or a small number of times such as once per
thread) at the beginning of a run and saving the compiled queries for
repeated use during the index traversal.

An attempt at caching queries was made with
\href{https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/pull/95}{Pull Request
  \#95}. Unfortunately, caching queries at best seemed to perform on
par with the latest GUFI and at worst, slightly slower than the latest
GUFI. This was true for both simple queries and complex queries with
\texttt{JOIN}s.
