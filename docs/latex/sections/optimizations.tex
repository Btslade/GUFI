\section{Optimizations}
In order for GUFI to be performant, many optimizations were used and
implemented.

\subsection{Allocations}
Dynamic allocations are more costly to make than static
allocations. To reduce the amount of dynamic allocations, C-string are
usually declared as fixed size arrays instead of pointers.

Additionally, allocations are not performed by the standard
malloc. Instead, \texttt{jemalloc(3)} is used to override
\texttt{malloc(3)}. See \href{https://jemalloc.net/}{jemalloc's
  website} for details.

\subsection{Combining Strings with \memcpy}
One method of combining C-strings is by concantenating them with
\texttt{snprintf(3)} with format strings containing only \texttt{\%s}
format specifiers. Instead of parsing the format string, the
\texttt{SNFORMAT\_S} function was created to do \memcpy s on
the arguments, skipping figuring out whether or not inputs are strings
and how long they are by finding NULL terminators. Instead, lengths are
obtained as by-products of previous string manipulations and the
values are reused.

\subsection{QueuePerThreadPool}
Thread pools are generally written with a single work thread (with a
single lock) from which to threads pull from. This does not work past
a handful of threads. GUFI can run on hundreds of threads, and thus
required a more performant thread pool. The solution to this was the
QueuePerThreadPool library. A work queue and lock are maintained for
each thread in the thread pool. Work is added to threads in a round
robin fashion in order to distribute work evenly and to attempt to
prevent, or at least reduce the amount of, contention experienced by any
one work queue. When work is popped off in preparation for processing,
instead of popping off one work item, all work items currently
enqueued are removed. This further reduces the contention the work
queues would experience if each work item were popped off one at a
time.

\subsection{Printing to \stdout}
Printing in parallel to a single target such as \stdout
without locking results in a jumble of text. Additionally, printing
incurs a base cost in addition to the amount of data being
printed. The OutputBuffers library, in conjunction with the
\texttt{print\_parallel} function found in the \gufiquery
source allow for data to be buffered to known, customizable sizes
before being written to \stdout.

\subsection{Rollups}
The most effective optimization made to GUFI was rollups. It allowed
for the number of directories that needed to be processed to be
reduced significantly. See Section~\ref{sec:rollup} for details.

\subsection{Database Templates}
Every directory in an index contains at least one database file called
db.db containing the \lstat data from the source filesystem. When
creating indicies, a database file is created with the same schema as
db.db and is left unfilled. When each directory in the index is
processed, the database file created earlier is copied into the
directory as a bytestream instead of having SQlite open new database
files for each directory. This avoids the multitudes of checks done by
SQLite when setting up databases and tables. The same is done for
external xattr database files.

\subsection{SQLite}
As SQLite is a major component in GUFI, attempts were made to optimize
its usage. Some optimizations were made at compile time. See the
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html}{SQLite Compile-time
  Options} page for details.

\subsubsection{Locking}
In order to prevent multiple threads from corrupting data, SQLite
implements locking. In GUFI, each database is only ever accessed by
one thread:

\begin{itemize}
\item When indexing, only one thread writes to each directory's
  database.
\item When querying, writes only occur when aggregating, which
  involves writing to a per-thread intermediate database before
  performing the final aggregating serially.
\end{itemize}

Locking despite never modifying databases in parallel was not useful,
and so was removed by setting \texttt{-DSQLITE\_THREADSAFE=0} in the
compile flags to remove all mutexes and logic related to thread
safety.

\subsubsection{Memory Tracking}
Memory tracking was disabled with \texttt{-DSQLITE\_DEFAULT\_MEMSTATUS=0}.

\subsubsection{Temporary Files}
Temporary files can be stored to disk or in memory. GUFI forces all
temporary files to be stored in memory with
\texttt{-DSQLITE\_TEMP\_STORE=3}.

\subsubsection{VFS}
In addition to not locking SQLite in-memory operations, locking at the
filesystem level was also removed. Instead of opening SQLite database
files with the default VFS, GUFI uses the \texttt{unix-none} VFS,
which causes all file locking to become no-ops. See
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/vfs.html}{The SQLite OS Interface or
  ``VFS''} for
details.
