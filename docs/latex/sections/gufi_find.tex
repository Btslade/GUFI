\section{\gufifind}
\gufifind is a wrapper script for \gufiquery that attempts to recreate
a large portion of GNU \find 's functionality.

One major difference between them is how arguments are parsed. In
\find, expression order matters. In \gufifind, expression order does
not matter.

\subsection{Flags}

The following \find test expression options are replicated. See \find
for details.

\begin{quote}
\texttt{-amin},  \texttt{-atime},  \texttt{-cmin},  \texttt{-ctime},
\texttt{-empty},  \texttt{-executable},  \texttt{-false},
\texttt{-fprint},  \texttt{-gid},  \texttt{-group},  \texttt{-help},
\texttt{-iname},  \texttt{-inum},  \texttt{-links},  \texttt{-lname},
\texttt{-maxdepth},  \texttt{-mindepth},  \texttt{-mmin},
\texttt{-mtime},  \texttt{-name},  \texttt{-newer},  \texttt{-path},
\texttt{-printf},  \texttt{-readable},  \texttt{-samefile},
\texttt{-size},  \texttt{-true},  \texttt{-type},  \texttt{-uid},
\texttt{-user},  and \texttt{-writable}
\end{quote}

The action expressions \texttt{printf} and \texttt{fprint} are also
available. \texttt{printf} writes to \texttt{stdout}, and
\texttt{fprint} writes to per-thread output text files. All format
specifiers other than \texttt{ACFTYZ} have been implemented.
\\\\
Additionally, a few GUFI extensions have been added:
\\\\
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline
Option & Description \\
\hline
-{}-size\% num num & Extends the \texttt{size} option to search for
sizes in the range \\
& [size + min\%, size + max\%]. \\
& e.g. \\
& \ \ \ \ \texttt{-size 100c -{}-size\% \ 10 20} \textrightarrow \ \texttt{[110, 120]} \\
& \ \ \ \ \texttt{-size 100c -{}-size\% -10 20} \textrightarrow \  \texttt{[90, \ 120]} \\
\hline
-{}-num-results num& Limit the number of results printed \\
\hline
-{}-smallest & Output by size, ascending. \\
\hline
-{}-largest & Output by size, descending. \\
\hline
-{}-in-memory-name name & Change the name of the tables used to store
intermediate \\
& results when aggregating. Generally not used. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
