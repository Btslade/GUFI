\subsection{SQLite Functions}
Several convenience functions are added into each database instance
opened for querying.

\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Function Name & Purpose \\
    \hline
    uidtouser & Converts a UID to a username \\
    \hline
    gidtogroup & Converts a GID to a username \\
    \hline
    modetotxt & Converts numerical permission bits to text \\
    \hline
    strftime & \texttt{strftime(3)} \\
    \hline
    blocksize & Converts a size to number of blocks \\
    \hline
    human\_readable\_size & Converts a size to a human readable value \\
    \hline
