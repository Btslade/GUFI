\subsection{\gufidirtrace}
\gufidirtrace is used to generate trace files that can be used to
build indexes. This tool was intended to allow for indicies to be
easily transfered to different locations rather than requiring entire
trees to be copied around.

\subsubsection{Trace Files}
Traces files are text files containing \lstat information pulled from
source filesystems separated by delimiters.

The default delimiter is the ASCII Record Separator character
\texttt{\textbackslash x1E}, but can be changed to any 8-bit
character. Characters that can appear in filesystems should not be
used as the delimiter in order to not confuse the ingester.

The metadata pulled from each directory is represented by a ``stanza''
in a trace file. A stanza starts with a line of directory metadata
followed by zero or more lines of regular file and symbolic link
metadata. Note that the summary of each directory is not stored in
trace files and are instead generated when the index is built.

\gufidirtrace walks source trees in parallel and outputs one trace
file per thread. Due to the parallelism, there are no guarantees as to
which thread's trace file a stanza might be written to. Once indexing
is completed, the trace files should be concatenated together to form
one large trace file for ingest.
