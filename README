Assimilating Gary's tarball from email 2017-11-26.  Leaving all the
old stuff in place for now, because I mainly just want to merge
the 'jti' branch, if git can manage that.

Use ./makeem to build all the currently-used
executables, which appear to be:

    bfwi
    bfti
    bfq

    querydb
    querydbn

    bfli ?
    bfmi ?  [mentioned in todo, but not built]
