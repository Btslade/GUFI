This represents a merge of tarballs that have been passed around in email
(latest 2017-12-06) with development that has stripped .c files off into a
library, added a Makefile, and moved C-Thread-Pool (our own fork) into a
git submodule.


--- build

  make clean  [optional]
  make

The build seems to be working on Linux (CentOS 7) and Darwin (10.12.6).

NOTE: We assume you have sqlite3 and mysql both installed.


--- run

The merged code has only been tested for applications bfwi, and bfti.

  bfwi ~jti/Desktop/auto_trash/test    0 16 0 0 1 0 1 .  [ 0 foo.out ]
  bfti ./Users/jti/Desktop/auto_trash/test 0 16 1


--- develop

For ongoing development, we're passing around a git archive tarball, made
from the "team" branch.  You can make edits in this tarball, and continue
to pass the tarball around.  I can merge them into the git repo
(git@git.lanl.gov:campaign/gufi.git)
