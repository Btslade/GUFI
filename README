Assimilating Gary's tarball from email 2017-11-28 (including
the segfault fix).

Leaving all the old stuff in place for now, because I mainly just want to
merge the 'jti' branch, if git can manage that.

Use ./makeem to build all the currently-used
executables, which appear to be:

    bfwi
    bfti
    bfq

    querydb
    querydbn
