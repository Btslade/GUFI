Installation instructions for the Grand Unified File-Index (GUFI).

Please pardon the dust!  We have ongoing efforts that are developing on
Ubuntu Xenial, OpenSUSE 12.3, OSX, CentOS (7.5), and Fedora.

Meanwhile, we have not yet completed our automated regression-testing.
Please let us know, if you have trouble.  (Details would
be appreciated; what OS you were using, what you tried, what went wrong.)

Thanks!



(0) Set up

# install build tools
A C compiler with C99 support
[optional] A C++ compiler with C++11 support (g++ 4.9.3, clang++-3.9, or newer)
CMake 3.0+
Make
pkg-config
realpath
truncate (with the '-s' option available)

# install packages (see platform-specific caveats, below)
xattr
pcre (version 1)
[optional] mysql
[optional] fuse      (osxfuse on OSX)
[optional] db2

# packages that are downloaded and built through a script
# locations for these packages can be provided (single prefix)
# in order to avoid downloading them
C-Thread-Pool
GoogleTest
paramiko
sqlite3
sqlite3-pcre

# clone GUFI
git clone https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI.git
cd GUFI

(2) ========== Build and install with CMake

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH> ..
make
make install

(2.1) Special configurations options

Set the environment variable CXX=false to disable building C++ code.
Set the CMake variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to build with warnings turned on.
Set the CMake variable PARAMIKO=ON to download and use paramiko through gufi_client
Set the CMake variable DEP_DOWNLOAD_PREFIX to select a location to find downloaded dependencies.
    If the expected files are found, they will not be downloaded.
Set the CMake variable DEP_BUILD_DIR_PREFIX to select a location to build the dependencies.
Set the CMake variable DEP_INSTALL_PREFIX to select the location to install the dependencies.
    If the dependencies are not installed in ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}, they will not need to be redownloaded/rebuilt/reinstalled everytime ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} is deleted.

(3) ========== Build and install with make

If cmake is not available, the tarball found at
https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/raw/tarball/gufi.tar.gz
can be built by running `make` in the extraction directory.
This tarball is generated through CMake with the command "make gary".

(4) Known build issuses

(4.1) (CentOS) submodule googletest build fails for cmake < 3.0

CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/WriteBasicConfigVersionFile.cmake:39 (message):
  No VERSION specified for WRITE_BASIC_CONFIG_VERSION_FILE()
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake/Modules/CMakePackageConfigHelpers.cmake:152 (write_basic_config_version_file)
  googletest/CMakeLists.txt:96 (write_basic_package_version_file)

See: https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/1786

--- FIX:
[as root]
yum install epel-release
yum remove cmake
yum install cmake3
ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake

(4.2) our build of test/googletest fails

-- WORK-AROUND
disable the C++ compiler when calling cmake ('CXX=false cmake')
