Installation instructions for the Grand Unified File-Index (GUFI).

Please pardon the dust!  We have ongoing efforts that are developing on
Ubuntu Xenial, OpenSUSE 12.3, OSX, CentOS (7.5), and Fedora.

Meanwhile, we have not yet completed our automated regression-testing.
Please let us know, if you have trouble.  (Details would
be appreciated; what OS you were using, what you tried, what went wrong.)

Thanks!

cd GUFI

(2) ========== Build and Install

(2.1) CMake

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install  # install into <PATH>
make package  # generate RPMs

(2.1.1) Configurations options

Environment:
    - CXX=false to disable building C++ code.

CMake (-D<VAR>=<VALUE>):
    - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH> to install to a custom directory when running `make install`
    - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to build with warnings and debugging symbols turned on.
    - CLIENT=ON to install paramiko and gufi_client
    - DEP_DOWNLOAD_PREFIX=<PATH> to select a location to find downloaded dependencies.
        If the expected files are found, they will not be downloaded.
        The default path points to the bundled dependencies.
    - DEP_BUILD_DIR_PREFIX=<PATH> to select a location to build the dependencies.
    - DEP_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH> to select the location to install the dependencies.
        If the dependencies are not installed in ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}, they will not need to be redownloaded/rebuilt/reinstalled everytime ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} is deleted.
    - BENCHMARK=On/Off
        Build so that gufi_query prints out some benchmarks at the end of a run.
        Make target 'benchmark' is created. This target generates a source tree,
        indexes it, and queries the tree. At each step, benchmark values will be
        printed. The tree is deleted after the benchmarks complete.
        Configuration variables
            - BENCHMARK_ROOT
            - BENCHMARK_DIRS    (default: 4)
            - BENCHMARK_DEPTH   (default: 10)
            - BENCHMARK_FILES   (default: 42)
            - BENCHMARK_THREADS (default: # of processors on the machine)

(2.2) Make
If cmake is not available, the tarball found at
https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/raw/tarball/gufi.tar.gz
can be built by running `make` in the extraction directory.
This tarball is generated through CMake with the command "make gary".

(2.3) RPM
Prebuilt binaries can be installed with RPMs, which can be found at
https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/releases/latest

(3) Running gufi_client
In order to run gufi_client, the patched paramiko should be installed.
Paramiko itself requires the libraries python-cryptography, python-bcrypt,
and python-pynacl. These should be installed through pip, not the OS
package manager. There is a script in contrib/python to install them.
There are also instructions for installing the libraries if your system
is offline, and the wheel files need to be downloaded manually.

(4) Known build issuses

(4.1) (CentOS) submodule googletest build fails for cmake < 3.0

CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/WriteBasicConfigVersionFile.cmake:39 (message):
  No VERSION specified for WRITE_BASIC_CONFIG_VERSION_FILE()
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake/Modules/CMakePackageConfigHelpers.cmake:152 (write_basic_config_version_file)
  googletest/CMakeLists.txt:96 (write_basic_package_version_file)

See: https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/1786

--- FIX:
[as root]
yum install epel-release
yum remove cmake
yum install cmake3
ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake

(4.2) our build of test/googletest fails

-- WORK-AROUND
disable the C++ compiler when calling cmake ('CXX=false cmake')
