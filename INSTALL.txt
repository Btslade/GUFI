Preliminary attempt to capture build-requirements


(1) CentOS 7.5

(1.1) submodule googletest build fails for cmake < 3.0

CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/WriteBasicConfigVersionFile.cmake:39 (message):
  No VERSION specified for WRITE_BASIC_CONFIG_VERSION_FILE()
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake/Modules/CMakePackageConfigHelpers.cmake:152 (write_basic_config_version_file)
  googletest/CMakeLists.txt:96 (write_basic_package_version_file)

See: https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/1786

--- FIX:
[as root]
yum install epel-release
yum remove cmake
yum install cmake3
ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake



(1.2) our build of test/googletest fails

-- WORK-AROUND
the 'test' make-target is now optional
don't build it



(1.3) compile fails for sqlite3 3.7.17 (CentOS 7.5), works for sqlite3 3.14.2 (Fedora)

-- FIX:

Upgrade to newer version.  There is no newer version available through yum repos, so do this:

download sqlite-src-xxxxx.zip [https://www.sqlite.org/download.html]
unzip sqlite-src-xxxxx.zip
cd sqlite-src-xxxxx
./configure
make clean
make
[as root] make install

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

This will allow the 'pkg-config' commands in the makefile to find this newer version.




(2) OSX

(1.1) Need osxfuse to build 'fuse'

This is an optional target.  If you need it, then ...

-- FIX:
sudo port install osxfuse   [tested with 3.8.2_0]


(1.2) need pcre

-- FIX:
sudo port install pcre     [tested with 8.42_0]



(1.3) sqlite3-pcre (submodule) doesn't build on OSX

-- WORK-AROUND:
* change "-Wl,-z,defs" to "-Wl,-undefined,error" in the Makefile
  in the the sqlite-pcre3 submodule.

TBD: We will spin off our own fork, and host that while waiting for a
    pull-request to the original developers.  Meanwhile, the
    work-around-above will allow you to build.
